                <h1>Grammar & Style Toolkit</h1>
                
                <p>Grammar isn't just about following rules; it's about clarity. In First-Year Writing, we focus less on "policing" language and more on ensuring your ideas aren't obstructed by mechanical roadblocks.</p>

                <h2>1. The "Big Three" Common Errors</h2>
                <p>If you master these three concepts, you will solve 90% of the sentence-level issues in your college papers.</p>
                
                <div class="callout-box">
                    <strong>1. The Fragment</strong><br>
                    An incomplete sentence that lacks a subject, a verb, or a complete thought.<br><br>
                    <em>The Error:</em> "Because I drank four Red Bulls."<br>
                    <em>The Fix:</em> "I can see sounds <strong>because</strong> I drank four Red Bulls." (Connected to a main clause).
                </div>

                <div class="callout-box">
                    <strong>2. The Run-on</strong><br>
                    Two independent sentences smushed together without punctuation.<br><br>
                    <em>The Error:</em> "I wrote this at 3 AM the printer is broken."<br>
                    <em>The Fix:</em> "I wrote this at 3 AM<strong>. The</strong> printer is broken." (Separated by a period).
                </div>

                <div class="callout-box">
                    <strong>3. The Comma Splice</strong><br>
                    Two independent sentences joined <em>only</em> by a comma (the most common college error!).<br><br>
                    <em>The Error:</em> "The market only has stale pretzels, I am going to starve."<br>
                    <em>The Fix:</em> "The market only has stale pretzels, <strong>so</strong> I am going to starve." (Added a conjunction).
                </div>

                <h2>2. Trusted External Resources</h2>
                <p>Don't rely on random Google searches. These are the gold-standard resources for college-level writing.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/grammar" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: underline; color: #00c6fb;">Khan Academy Grammar</a></strong><br>
                    A comprehensive, free course that breaks down everything from parts of speech to complex syntax. Great for visual learners.</li>
                    
                    <li style="margin-top: 1rem;"><strong><a href="https://writingcenter.unc.edu/tips-and-tools/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: underline; color: #00c6fb;">UNC Chapel Hill Writing Center</a></strong><br>
                    Their "Tips & Tools" section is excellent. They offer short, readable handouts on specific issues like "Passive Voice" or "Flow."</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>3. GenAI & Your Writing Voice</h2>
                <p>Generative AI (like ChatGPT) can be a useful tool, but it can also flatten your writing style. You need to <strong>constrain</strong> the AI so it doesn't delete your personality.</p>

                <div class="callout-box">
                    <strong>1. Draft First, AI Second</strong><br>
                    Never start with a blank page and an AI prompt. Write your messy first draft yourself. Only use AI to critique what you have already written.
                </div>

                <div class="callout-box">
                    <strong>2. Constrain the AI (The "Hands Off" Prompt)</strong><br>
                    If you ask AI to "fix this," it will rewrite your entire paragraph to sound like a robot. Instead, give it strict boundaries:<br><br>
                    <em>"Please proofread the following paragraph for grammar errors only. List the errors you find, but <strong>DO NOT rewrite the paragraph</strong> or change my tone. I want to make the changes myself."</em>
                </div>

                <div class="callout-box">
                    <strong>3. The "Read Aloud" Test</strong><br>
                    After you make edits, read your paper out loud. If you stumble over a word or if a sentence sounds too fancy for your normal speaking voice, the AI probably inserted it. Cut it out. Your professor wants to hear <em>your</em> voice, not a machine's.
