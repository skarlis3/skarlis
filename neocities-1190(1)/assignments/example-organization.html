    <h2>Sample Ways to Structure Your Research Paper</h2>

    <!-- At a Glance -->
    <div class="glance-accent-box">
      <h3>At a Glance</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>There is no single “correct” way to organize Project 1.</li>
        <li>Each model below is a <b>full paper structure</b> made of sections (not single paragraphs).</li>
        <li>Choose the model that best fits your topic, field, and main idea.</li>
        <li>You can mix and match ideas from different models as long as your paper stays clear and organized.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>



    <!-- Overview -->
    <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
    <p>
      Project 1 asks you to put different kinds of sources into conversation in order to explore how AI is being used,
      discussed, and debated in your chosen field. The models below give you <b>three possible ways</b> to organize your paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      For each model, you will see:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>a short description,</li>
      <li>when the model might work well for you,</li>
      <li>a generic outline, and</li>
      <li>a sample outline using technical theatre as the example field.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      You can use one of these models, adapt one, or combine ideas from more than one.
      Whatever you choose, your paper must still meet all requirements in the
      <a href="project1-overview.html">Project 1: Research Paper Overview</a>.

    <h3>Possible Organization Models Summary</h3>
     <div class="indented-text">
    <h4 style="margin-bottom: 0.3em; margin-top: 0.8em;">Model 1: Organized by Research Type</h4>
      <p>
        This model organizes your paper by <b>type of source</b>:
        public conversations, news coverage, and scholarly research. You then add a separate
        section where you put these groups in conversation with each other.
      </p>
      <h4 style="margin-bottom: 0.3em;">Model 2: Organized by Sub-Topic</h4>
        <p>This model organizes your paper around <b>2–3 major sub-topics</b> or themes that came up in your research. Each section mixes together public conversations, news, and scholarly sources.
        </p>

      <h4 style="margin-bottom: 0.3em;">Model 3: Organized by Stakeholders</h4>
        <p>
          This model organizes your paper by <b>who</b> is affected by AI in your field.
