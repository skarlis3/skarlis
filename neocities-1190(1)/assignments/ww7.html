    <!-- Overview -->
    <h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
    <p>Now that you have read scholarly articles and gathered additional research, your next step is to begin shaping these ideas into an organized plan you can build on when drafting your paper. This assignment helps you:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>identify the major points you want to make,</li>
      <li>think through how your ideas connect,</li>
      <li>begin organizing your evidence, and</li>
      <li>create a working outline you will keep adding to over the next few weeks.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This is not a final outline—it’s the foundation for your drafting process.</p>

    <!-- Instructions -->
    <h3 id="part1">Part 1: Brainstorming (Choose ONE Option)</h3>
    <p>Select the method that helps you organize your thinking best. You only need to complete one of the three options below.</p>

    <h4 id="option1">Option 1: Freewrite (8–10 minutes)</h4>
    <p>Write continuously for 8–10 minutes about your developing paper topic. You can handwrite this and upload a clear photo (make sure it is not blurry), or you can type it.</p>
    <p>Use prompts like:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>What seems to matter most about how AI is impacting your field?</li>
      <li>What themes keep showing up in your scholarly, news, or social media sources?</li>
      <li>What problems, controversies, or opportunities do you see?</li>
      <li>What do you think your paper will need to explain or argue?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Keep this informal—just get your ideas on the page. This can be submitted as a photo if you want to write on paper.</p>

    <h4 id="option2">Option 2: Big 3 Questions</h4>
    <p>Answer the following questions in complete but informal sentences:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><b>Main claim or purpose:</b> What do you think your main claim or purpose might be?</li>
      <li><b>Major points:</b> What 2–4 major points could help you explain or support that claim?</li>
      <li><b>Connected sources:</b> Which of your sources seem connected to each of those major points?</li>
    </ol>

    <h4 id="option3">Option 3: Generative AI Conversation for Idea Development</h4>
    <p>Use an AI tool (such as ChatGPT) as a thinking partner to help you clarify your ideas—not as a source of information. The goal is to have the AI ask you questions and help you notice themes, not to give you ready-made answers.</p>

    <p>Start a new chat with the AI and paste a version of this prompt:</p>
    <blockquote>
      “Help me clarify the main points for a research paper I’m writing. I will explain what I’ve learned from my sources so far. Your job is to ask me questions that help me figure out themes, connections, and main points—but do NOT create arguments or claims for me. Only ask questions or help me sort my own ideas. My topic is: [your topic]. Here is what I’ve learned so far: [explain in your own words].”
    </blockquote>
    <p>Then continue the conversation by answering the AI’s questions and thinking through your ideas based on your research.</p>

    <p><b>What to submit for Option 3:</b> A copy/paste of the conversation or a clearly readable screenshot (saved as a PDF or Word document is preferred).</p>

    <h3 id="part2">Part 2: Working Outline</h3>
    <p>Using the thinking you did in Part 1, create a simple working outline that you will continue developing as you draft your paper. This outline should be flexible and in-progress, not a polished final version.</p>

    <p>Your outline must include:</p>

    <ol>
      <li><b>Field/Career:</b> Remind me of the field or career you are focusing on.</li>

      <li><b>Topic / Working Thesis:</b> Write a rough working thesis or purpose statement.<br/>
        <em>(What about AI in your field do you plan to explore, explain, or argue?)</em>
      </li>

      <li><b>Numbered List of Possible Subtopics:</b>
        <p>Create a numbered list of 2–4 major points or sections that might appear in your paper. These should come from your freewrite, Big 3 responses, or AI conversation from Part 1.</p>
      </li>

      <li><b>Sources Under Each Subtopic:</b>
        <p>Under each numbered subtopic, briefly list which sources might support that point. This may include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>scholarly articles,</li>
          <li>news articles,</li>
          <li>social media posts or comments.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You will eventually get these sources “in conversation” with each other as you draft. You are not required to fully integrate them yet.</p>
      </li>
      <li><b>AI Transparency Statement:</b>
        <p>At the bottom of your outline, include a transparency statement that explains whether you used AI for this part of the assignment. If you did not use AI at all for the outline, state that for this part. See more information and examples below.</p></li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Using AI for Part 2 (Optional)</h4>
    <p>You may use AI to help you think through and organize your outline, but the final outline must reflect your own decisions and your understanding of your research.</p>

    <p>If you use AI during this part:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Ask the AI to generate <b>two different outline options</b> based on your ideas from Part 1.</li>
      <li>You may choose one, combine parts of both, or <b>revise the AI-generated outlines</b> in any way you need to make them fit your research. You do not need to accept either outline as-is.</li>
      <li>Your finished outline should clearly be the product of your own thinking, not a copied AI output.</li>
      <li>Submit the prompt(s) you used and the AI-generated outline options along with your final outline.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Required AI Transparency Statement (All Students Must Include This)</h3>
    <p>At the bottom of your outline, include an AI Transparency Statement that briefly explains:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>whether you used AI for any part of this assignment (Part 1 or Part 2), and</li>
      <li>if you did, how you used AI (1–2 sentences).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If you did not use AI, your statement should simply state that.</p>

    <p><b>Examples:</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li><em>AI Transparency Statement:</em> I used ChatGPT to generate two possible outline structures after completing Part 1. I combined parts of both outlines and revised them to match my research.</li>
      <li><em>AI Transparency Statement:</em> I did not use AI for this assignment.</li>
    </ul>

        <!-- Grading -->
    <h3 id="grading">Grading</h3>
    <p><i>Note: This week’s Weekly Writing assignment will be worth three points rather than the usual two. Because of that, it carries a slightly higher weight in the grade book to reflect the added complexity and workload for this assignment.</i><p>

            <div class="grid-item">✓– (1/3)</div>
