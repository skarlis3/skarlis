          <li>Note: A news article should come from a newspaper (online or otherwise), not a company website or blog. Consider using <a href="https://apnews.com/search">AP news</a>, <a href="https://news.google.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">news.google.com</a>, or selecting “News” from a Google or Bing search to find the articles.</li>

      </li>
      <li>Read the articles and then save them as PDFs (Similar to WW3, you will be submitting them with this assignment).</li>

        <i>Note: Just list these answers for each of the articles (no need to write in essay/paragraph format).</i>
        <ul>
          <li>Name of article</li>
          <li>Name of publication (i.e. name of newspaper)</li>
          <li>Date published</li>
          <li>Source assessment:
            <ul>
              <li>Is this article a news story or an opinion article? How can you tell?</li>
              <li>Does the article seem biased? Based on opinion? Does it seem backed with research? How can you tell?</li>
              <li>How does this article relate to the other articles you saved and read? (i.e. does it talk about different uses of AI? Does it take a similar or difference stance? etc.)</li>
              <li>How does this article relate to the conversations you read/watched online for Weekly Writing 3?</li>
            </ul>
