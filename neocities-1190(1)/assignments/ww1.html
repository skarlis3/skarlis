    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>This section of ENGL&nbsp;1190 will focus on college majors/career paths and the impact and trends of artificial intelligence in those fields. For this first Weekly Writing, you’ll write a short essay exploring your major and/or possible career paths.</p>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <p>Choose <em>one</em> of the following options for your short essay:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Option 1: You have a declared major or plan</strong>
        <div class="list-para">What is your major? Why is it interesting to you or why did you choose it? What do you plan to do with this major (what careers are you considering)?</div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Option 2: You’re undecided or exploring</strong>
        <div class="list-para">What majors and/or careers are you considering? What about them interests you? Which one(s) would you be interested in focusing on this semester as a starting place for your writing and research?</div>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p><em>Reminder:</em> Always check the requirements above for the minimum word count each week. Don’t list the prompts and answer them one-by-one—use them to guide a coherent paragraph-based response.</p>
