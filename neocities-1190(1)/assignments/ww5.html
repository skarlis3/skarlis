    <!-- Overview -->
    <h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
    <p>
      For Project 1, you will eventually need to work with peer-reviewed scholarly research about AI in your field. 
      Before you choose a final research question, it helps to know where the scholarly conversations actually are.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this Weekly Writing, you will explore <b>possible scholarly directions</b> for your paper and test whether each direction
      has enough research behind it. You are <b>not</b> choosing your final research question yet. Instead, you are mapping out
      which scholarly paths seem promising based on what you can find.
    </p>

    <!-- AI Use -->
    <h3 id="ai-use">Using AI Tools for This Assignment</h3>
    <p>
      You may use an AI tool (such as ChatGPT) only to help you locate
      <b>real, peer-reviewed scholarly sources</b> that you can access through Macomb’s library or Google Scholar.
    </p>
    <p>If you choose to use AI:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Ask for peer-reviewed scholarly research only.</li>
      <li>Ask it to provide links or DOIs so you can verify the sources.</li>
      <li>Double-check every source by opening it yourself.</li>
      <li>If you cannot open a source or it looks suspicious, do not use it.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Suggested AI prompt:</b></p>
    <blockquote>
      Help me find real peer-reviewed scholarly research on AI and [my field]. 
      Only list sources that actually exist and that I can open through Google Scholar or Macomb’s library. 
      Provide links or DOIs so I can verify them. Do not invent or guess citations.
    </blockquote>

    <p>You can also complete this assignment <b>without AI</b> by using Macomb’s library databases and/or <a href="https://scholar.google.com">Google Scholar</a>.</p>

    <!-- Instructions -->
    <h3 id="instructions">Instructions</h3>
    <p>In your response, complete all four parts below. You can use headings or paragraph breaks to keep yourself organized.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <b>List 2–3 possible scholarly directions/topics.</b><br/>
        These should be possible angles about AI in your field that you might explore further.
        They do not need to be fully formed research questions yet.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>For each direction, try at least two keyword searches.</b><br/>
        Use Macomb’s databases, Google Scholar, and/or an AI research helper (following the AI rules above).
        Make a note of which keywords you tried.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Briefly summarize what you found.</b><br/>
        For each direction:
        <ul>
          <li>Did you find scholarly articles on this topic?</li>
          <li>What issues or questions showed up in the titles or abstracts?</li>
          <li>Did you have to adjust your keywords to get better results?</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Reflect on which direction seems most promising and why.</b><br/>
        You are not committing to anything yet. You are simply identifying which scholarly thread looks most
        researchable and interesting for you to follow into Week 6.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      <b>Purpose:</b> This assignment helps you avoid topics that are too broad, too simple, or not well-researched. 
      It also prepares you for Weekly Writing 6, where you will begin reading and annotating scholarly articles.
    </p>

    <!-- Sample Response -->
    <div class="tips-accent-box">
      <h3 id="sample">Sample Response (Technical Theatre)</h3>
      <p><b>Field:</b> Technical Theatre</p>

      <p><b>1. Possible scholarly directions</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>AI-generated design and artistic authorship in technical theatre</li>
        <li>AI-assisted lighting and cue automation</li>
        <li>Safety and reliability concerns with automated technical systems</li>
      </ul>

      <p><b>2. Keyword searches and what I found</b></p>

      <p><b>Direction 1:</b> AI-generated design and artistic authorship</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Keywords tried: “AI art theatre design,” “AI projection design authorship.”</li>
        <li>I found articles on AI-generated art and creative authorship in digital arts. They are not always about theatre specifically, but they discuss how AI complicates ideas of originality and ownership.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><b>Direction 2:</b> AI-assisted lighting and cue automation</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Keywords tried: “automation theatre lighting,” “AI cueing systems stage technology.”</li>
        <li>I found a few articles on automated lighting control and live event technology. They focus on efficiency and the need for experienced operators, which could connect to theatre.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><b>Direction 3:</b> Safety and reliability of automated systems</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Keywords tried: “automated systems risk live performance,” “safety automation performing arts.”</li>
        <li>I found stronger scholarship here, especially on risk management and the importance of human oversight when using automated systems in performance spaces.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><b>3. Reflection: which direction seems most promising?</b></p>
      <p>
        Right now, the <b>safety and reliability</b> direction seems the strongest because there is clear scholarly research
        that I can use, and it connects directly to technicians’ concerns I saw in the public conversations. 
        The authorship direction is also interesting, but it may require applying research from digital art more broadly, 
        while the safety topic seems more closely tied to live performance and technical risk.
      </p>
