    <h1>Project 2: Example Exhibits</h1>

    <div class="callout">
      <h3>Note on Examples</h3>
      <p>Because this is the first semester I am assigning this specific project, I do not have student examples to show you yet.</p>
      <p>The images below were generated by Gemini AI to demonstrate the <strong>visual vibe</strong> and <strong>layout concepts</strong> of the exhibit. They are intended to inspire your creativity, not to prescribe exactly how your project must look.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Full Exhibit Concepts</h2>
    <p>These examples demonstrate how you might arrange artifacts, placards, and visual elements to create a cohesive theme (Utopian or Dystopian).</p>

    <figure>
      <img src="/img/example-exhibit-1.png" alt="Table display with caution tape showing a Dystopian future">
      <figcaption><strong>Example 1 (The System Failure):</strong> A table display using "Caution" tape to separate the "Ancient Crafts" (2024-2028) from the "System Failure" (2050). Note the use of physical props, like a "handed down tool" in a glass box.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <figure>
      <img src="/img/example-exhibit-2.png" alt="Tri-fold board showing a timeline of AI in technical theatre">
      <figcaption><strong>Example 2 (The Retrospective):</strong> A classic tri-fold board layout. This exhibit uses a central timeline to bridge the gap between the past and the future, contrasting the "Transition" phase with the eventual "System Failure."</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <figure>
      <img src="/img/example-exhibit-3.png" alt="Cardboard display showing a 'Dark Age' aesthetic">
      <figcaption><strong>Example 3 (The Dark Age):</strong> A creative use of materials. This display uses rough cardboard and "weathered" artifacts to match the "Dark Age of Automation" theme, making the exhibit itself feel like a scavenged object from 2050.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <h2>Alternative Display Layouts</h2>
    <p>The following images are included just to give you ideas for <strong>how to display items</strong> (using crates, ladders, or props). Please note that these are not complete exhibits; they are just structural inspiration.</p>

    <figure>
      <img src="/img/example-exhibit-4.png" alt="Display idea using a stepladder and milk crates">
      <figcaption><strong>Display Idea A:</strong> Using vertical space. This setup uses a small stepladder and stacked milk crates to display artifacts at eye level without needing a large poster board.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <figure>
      <img src="/img/example-exhibit-5.png" alt="Display idea using a suitcase and PVC pipe frame">
      <figcaption><strong>Display Idea B:</strong> Using props as containers. An open suitcase displays "obsolete knowledge" and physical artifacts, while a simple PVC pipe frame allows documents to hang vertically.</figcaption>
    </figure>
