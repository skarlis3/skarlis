    <!-- Overview -->
    <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
    <p>
      The rough draft is your first draft of your research paper for Project 1. It does <b>not</b> need to be polished or perfectly organized.
      Instead, it should show substantial progress and help you participate meaningfully in in-class peer review.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your job in this draft is to get your ideas out, start putting your sources together, and take a real step toward your final paper.
      You will revise and refine this draft later in the unit and again for your Final Portfolio.
    </p>

    <!-- Requirements Detail -->
    <h2 id="requirements-detail">Minimum Requirements for Credit</h2>
    <p>
      To receive full credit and to take part in peer review, your rough draft must:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Be at least 80% complete:</b>  
        Minimum <b>1600 words</b> of your Project 1 research paper (the final paper minimum is 2000 words).
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Include evidence from all three required source types:</b>
        <ul>
          <li>Public conversations (such as social media or other community discussions)</li>
          <li>Trustworthy news articles</li>
          <li>Peer-reviewed scholarly articles</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Recommended: Include the beginnings of a References page. </b>  
        This does not need to be perfect or complete yet. You may use placeholders or notes to yourself so you don’t lose track of sources.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p> I will not give feedback on this draft. Feedback will come from your peers during in-class peer review.
    </p>

    <!-- Tips -->
    <h2 id="tips">Tips for Writing the Rough Draft</h2>
    <p>
      The goal of this draft is to make real progress, not to create a perfect paper. Use the ideas below to help you get started and keep going.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Use your brainstorming and working outline from Weekly Writing 7.</b><br/>
        WW7 was designed to help you start shaping this paper. Look back at your sub-topics, your working thesis, and the sources you connected to each section.
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Expect the topic to shift a little as you write.</b><br/>
        It’s normal for your focus to narrow, adjust, or become clearer while drafting. You might discover you need an additional source
        or a slightly different angle—that’s okay and often part of the process.
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Don’t feel like you have to write the paper in order.</b><br/>
        Many writers save the introduction for last. Start with a section you feel more confident about and build from there.
        You can rearrange and add transitions later.
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>If you prefer working in order, I recommend using placeholder notes.</b><br/>
        Leave yourself small reminders like:<br/>
        <em>[Add example from news article here]</em><br/>
        <em>[Explain this point more]</em><br/>
        <em>[Insert quote from scholarly source]</em><br/>
        This keeps you moving instead of getting stuck in one spot.
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Don’t strive for perfection—seriously.</b><br/>
        This is a rough draft; it can be messy. As Anne Lamott explains in her essay
        <a href="https://wrd.as.uky.edu/sites/default/files/1-Shitty%20First%20Drafts.pdf" target="_blank">“Shitty First Drafts”</a>,
        good writing usually starts with bad first drafts. Focus on getting your ideas out; revision comes later.
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Start early.</b><br/>
        This project asks you to bring together multiple sources and put them in conversation (synthesis).
        You will need time to read, think, write, and adjust your ideas as you go. This is not a “write it the night before” paper.
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Review the Example Organization page.</b><br/>
        If you feel stuck on structure, revisit the
        <a href="project1-organization.html">Project 1: Example Organization</a> page and choose a model that matches your topic and sources.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <!-- Submission Details -->
    <h2 id="submission">Submission Details</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Submit your rough draft (at least 1600 words) as a document on Canvas.</li>
      <li>Bring your draft to class on the scheduled peer review day (digital or printed, depending on instructions).</li>
      <li>Drafts that do not meet the minimum requirements may not be used for in-class peer review.</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- Peer Review / Make-up -->
    <h2 id="peer-review">If You Cannot Attend In-Class Peer Review</h2>
    <p>
      It is important to complete this draft on time so that you can participate in in-class peer review.
      If you experience an emergency, illness, or major life event that prevents you from either:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>submitting the rough draft on time, or</li>
      <li>attending class on the peer review day,</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      you will be required to get feedback on your draft from a writing tutor at the Academic Success Center.
      See the <a href="peer-review.html">Peer Review</a> page for more information and specific instructions.
