    <h1>Project 2: Building the Exhibit</h1>


    <h2>Step 4: Museum Exhibit Display</h2>
    <p>The final step will be putting together your museum display. For the exhibit day, we will be meeting in a large classroom, so you will have more space.</p>
    
    <h3>Display Options</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>A classroom table (a desk/table that fits two students).</li>
        <li>An area of floor space to put your display up (for larger/taller displays).</li>
        <li>A combination of the two.</li>
    </ol>

        <div class="glance-accent-box">
      <h3>Important Note</h3>
      <p>Make sure you are able to set up your exhibit in <strong>5–10 minutes</strong>! If you think you need more time than that, come talk to me to see if we can get you in the room a little early.</p>

      <h3>Exhibit Requirements</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Theme:</strong> Has a clear theme (i.e., Utopian vs. Dystopian future).</li>
        <li><strong>Design:</strong> Designed and implemented to represent both your field and take on the theme (i.e., decorate/design your exhibit with purpose).</li>
        <li><strong>Cohesion:</strong> Museum artifacts displayed cohesively.</li>
        <li><strong>Connections:</strong> Clear connections and additional information (such as on museum placards or visual design elements) to help guide the reader through the display.</li>
        <li><strong>Optional:</strong> You may also include memes, images, etc., to round out your museum exhibit. Have some fun with this!</li>
      </ul>

    <h2>Placards</h2>
    <p>Each artifact needs a museum placard with the author, year, and description, similar to what you would see in an actual museum.</p>
