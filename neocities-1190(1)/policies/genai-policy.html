    <h1>Generative AI Policy</h1>
    <p>If you choose to use Generative AI in this class, you are responsible for understanding and following these guidelines.<br/>Be aware that AI policies differ by instructor and class—always review each course’s expectations.</p>

    <div class="glance-accent-box">
      <h2>At a Glance</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Brainstorming:</strong> AI can help you generate ideas for topics, but the conclusions must be your own.</li>
    <li><strong>Research:</strong> You may use AI tools to find sources, but you must read and cite the original articles—not AI summaries.</li>
    <li><strong>Writing & Revision:</strong> Draft first, then use AI to clarify or polish small sections. Review all output carefully.</li>
    <li><strong>Voice & Accuracy:</strong> Keep your own voice and double-check all facts; AI can be incorrect or overly generic.</li>
    <li><strong>Best Use:</strong> Treat AI as a tool for organization or feedback—not as a writer or a source of ideas.</li>
  </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Using AI for Brainstorming</h2>
    <p>You may use AI tools to help generate ideas or topics. However, the main content, writing, research, and conclusions must be your own.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use AI brainstorming results only as a starting point, not as material to include directly.</li>
      <li>Do not take or adapt AI-generated ideas as if they were research. All research in this course must come from your own primary or scholarly sources, which must be cited.</li>
      <li>For example, if you’re struggling to choose a research topic for Project 1, you may use AI to generate a list of general ideas—but you’ll then develop your own research question and locate your own sources.</li>
      <li>You may also use GenAI to help you work through your thoughts by having a conversation with it. However, you should include instructions and context so that it 1) doesn't automatically just agree with everything you say, and 2) understands your goals and the assignment.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Using AI for Research</h2>
    <p>You may use specialized AI research tools (like Semantic Scholar, Research Rabbit, Scite, Consensus, Connected Papers, or Elicit) to help locate academic sources.</p>
    <p>However:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You must read the original articles rather than rely on AI summaries.</li>
      <li>All quotes and paraphrases must come from the original sources, not from AI-generated text.</li>
      <li>Always fact-check AI-provided information. AI tools can “hallucinate” or produce incorrect or incomplete data.</li>
      <li>Be cautious about using general-purpose AI tools (such as ChatGPT or Claude) for research—they are not designed for academic accuracy and may misrepresent information.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Using AI for Writing &amp; Revision</h2>
    <p>AI can be useful for revising, organizing, or proofreading your own drafts—after you’ve already written them.</p>
    <p>Guidelines for appropriate use:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Write out your own ideas first, even if they’re messy. Then use AI to organize, clarify, or improve the writing.</li>
      <li>Work on small sections at a time (for example, a single paragraph).</li>
      <li>Review all output carefully. You are responsible for ensuring your ideas and sources remain accurate and your own.</li>
      <li>Protect your writing voice. Use AI to strengthen your writing, not replace it.</li>
      <li>When revising, ask for specific help (clarity, concision, grammar) rather than a total rewrite.</li>
      <li>AI can assist with grammar and proofreading if used carefully and reviewed afterward.</li>
      <li>You may also ask AI to identify your most common writing errors so you can focus on improving one skill at a time.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Remember, this course emphasizes growth and practice. You’ll have opportunities to learn, revise, and make mistakes without penalty before the final portfolio.</p>

    <h2>Understanding the Issues with AI Writing</h2>
    <p>AI-generated text often appears polished but lacks depth, accuracy, and originality. It tends to overgeneralize, repeat ideas, and miss nuance—especially in academic contexts.</p>
    <p>Be cautious of:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Letting AI generate or replace your ideas.</li>
      <li>Losing your writing voice and producing generic, robotic prose.</li>
      <li>Introducing errors or misrepresentations into your research through inaccurate AI summaries.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>AI is best used as a tool—for organization, feedback, and mechanical assistance—not as a writer or source of ideas.</p>
