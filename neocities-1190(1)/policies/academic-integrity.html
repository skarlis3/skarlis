    <h1>Academic Honesty, Plagiarism, &amp; Generative AI Policy</h1>

    <h2>Academic Honesty</h2>
    <p>Academic honesty is highly valued at Macomb. It is important to submit work that represents your own original words and ideas. Whenever you use another person’s words or ideas, cite all relevant sources and clearly indicate the extent to which those sources were used. This includes all hard copy or electronic publications, all verbal or visual communication, and any submissions to public meetings or mailboxes.</p>

    <div class="glance-accent-box">
    <h2>Plagiarism &amp; Academic Integrity: At a Glance</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Do your own work.</li>
      <li>Cite your sources.</li>
      <li>Don’t copy off the internet or from GenAI.</li>
      <li>Don’t reuse work without permission.</li>
      <li>Don’t fabricate or misrepresent research.
        <div class="list-para">(This includes inventing sources, quotes, paraphrases, or data.)</div>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>But also—don’t panic about this. This is a research writing class, which means you’ll be learning how to do all this properly, and there will be room for mistakes and opportunities to improve along the way.</p>
        </div>

    <h2>Research Writing &amp; Accidental Plagiarism</h2>
    <p>Because this course teaches research writing and citation, issues with paraphrasing and citation are often treated as learning opportunities. Students will usually be given a chance to resolve the issue and/or redo the assignment. However, it is each student’s responsibility to attend class and learn how to use and cite sources appropriately.</p>
    <p>Assignments that are copied in part or in full from another source with no attempt to cite may be reported to the college at the instructor’s discretion and may not be eligible for resubmission.</p>
    <p>In short: if you are attempting to use sources correctly but struggling, you will have opportunities to fix the problem. If there is no apparent effort to use research ethically—or if it seems that plagiarism, fabrication, or other dishonest behavior was intentional—the issue will fall under the academic dishonesty policy below.</p>

    <h2>Plagiarism &amp; Academic Integrity Policy</h2>
    <p>Serious or unresolved instances of academic dishonesty (including plagiarism or fabrication) may result in a lowered grade, a zero on the assignment with no opportunity for resubmission, or failure in the course, depending on the degree and type of dishonesty. An academic integrity report may also be filed with the college.</p>
    <p>Academic dishonesty may include, but is not limited to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Having someone complete an assignment for you</li>
      <li>Having someone make extensive revisions or rewrites to your paper</li>
      <li>Copying work or ideas from another student</li>
      <li>Copying or purchasing assignments or text from the internet</li>
      <li>Using outside information without proper citation</li>
      <li>Fabricating research—such as inventing sources, quotes, paraphrases, data, or misrepresenting what a source says</li>
      <li>Reusing work from another class without permission</li>
      <li>Using AI in inappropriate or dishonest ways (see <a href="/policies/genai-policy.html">Generative AI Policy</a>)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Since this is a research writing class, you will be incorporating ideas from other texts. Those ideas must always be quoted, paraphrased, or summarized with proper citation.</p>
    <p>We’ll go over this more in class, but the basic principle is simple: don’t copy ideas or information from others without crediting where they came from.</p>
