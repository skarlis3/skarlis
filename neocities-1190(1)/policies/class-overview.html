    <h1>Class Overview</h1>

    <p>The full syllabus, which includes class meeting times, office hours, and my contact information, can be found on Canvas.</p>

    <h2>Course Information</h2>

    <h3>Course Description</h3>
    <p>The focus of this course is to continue the development of writing skills learned in ENGL 1181 or ENGL 1210. This course places extensive emphasis upon research and documentation.</p>
    <p>Students who have completed ENGL 1220 successfully should NOT take ENGL 1190. Students will NOT receive credit for both.</p>

    <h3>What to expect...</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Show up! If you miss a lot of classes, you will be confused and fall behind.</li>
      <li>But... please, don’t show up to class if you are sick. Missing one or two classes won’t be catastrophic. Show up when you are healthy and able, and it won’t be as difficult if you need to miss a couple of classes if something happens (illness or otherwise).</li>
      <li>There will be lots of writing. It’s a writing class.</li>
      <li>There will be in-class writing assignments, along with the assigned writing assignments. We will often work in groups during class to work on writing concepts. Active participation is crucial to your success in this class.</li>
      ]<li>Be polite and respectful to your peers. You will need to share much of your writing, so it’s important that this is a safe space.</li>
      <li>You get two late freebies that will let you turn a paper or assignment in one week late, no questions asked. No more, no less. (See late policy for more information).</li>
      <li>If you need to meet, I have office hours and an email address (found on the first page of the syllabus).</li>
      <li>Check your Canvas Inbox regularly for any updates and important information for this class.</li>
      <li>Familiarize yourself with the location of computer labs on campus, the library, and other student resources.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Course Outcomes</h3>
    <p>Outcome 1: Upon completion of this course, the student will be able to produce a formal research paper that is explanatory, analytical, or persuasive.</p>
    <p>Outcome 2: Upon completion of this course, the student will be able to demonstrate skills in applied composition, in applied argument or technical/career writing, or both.</p>
