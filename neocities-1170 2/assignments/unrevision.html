    <h1>Unrevision</h1>

    <p>The core of this project is the "unrevision." You will take your polished Project 1 essay and intentionally apply course concepts to make the essay as ineffective as possible (while still technically readable). This demonstrates your mastery of those concepts by showing you know exactly how to break them.</p>

        <div class="glance-accent-box">
      <h2>Important Reminder</h2>
      <p>Before you start any of the unrevision, please <strong>make a copy</strong> of your Final Genre Analysis Essay from ENGL 1181.</p>
      <p>You need to keep the polished version safe for your ENGL 1181 Final Portfolio. Do not begin unrevising your only copy of the essay!</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Unrevision Guidelines</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>The unrevised paper must still be roughly the same length as the original (i.e. don't unrevise by deleting giant chunks of the paper).</li>
      <li>The unrevised paper must still be mostly readable so that the rhetorical moves can still be seen.
        <ul>
          <li>For example, the font cannot be completely illegible and the paper still needs to be written in English.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>The unrevision must be intentional and demonstrate concepts that were learned in ENGL 1170 and 1181.</li>
      <li>The unrevision must focus on some high and middle-order concerns. You may also introduce later-order concerns, but the bulk of the unrevision should be focused on bigger-picture issues, such as organization, design, flow, paragraphing, etc.</li>
      <li>Keep track of the changes you are making (and why you are making them) so that you can add the annotations on the presentation.</li>
    </ol>

      <h3>Tip</h3>
      <p>I strongly suggest that you use Word Online or Google Docs for this part of the project so that you can keep track of your changes and revert/undo changes if necessary.</p></div>
