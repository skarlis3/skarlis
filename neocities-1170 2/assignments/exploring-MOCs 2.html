    <h1>Exploring Middle Order Concerns (MOCs)</h1>

    <p>For this project, you'll be choosing one middle-order concern writing issue and then creating a handout for that design element for your classmates. This assignment will work similarly to the last exploration assignment, and you will also explain the concept to your classmates in class.</p>

    <p>Middle Order Concern (MOC) Writing Issue (you will sign up for one of these in class):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Paragraphing</li>
      <li>Transitions</li>
      <li>Flow</li>
      <li>Organization</li>
      <li>Introductions</li>
      <li>Conclusions</li>
      <li>Voice and Style</li>
      <li>Clarity</li>
      <li>Conciseness</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>

    <h3>Step 1</h3>
    <p>Using one of the resources below or another resource you found online/in a book, learn more about your element/principle of design.</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://writingcenter.unc.edu/tips-and-tools/">UNC Writing Center</a></li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Specific Concepts</strong></p>

    </ul>

    <p>You can look up additional resources, such as YouTube videos or other websites to help you understand these concepts, just make sure to include a link to all sources at the bottom of your handout, including any of the above links. If you use an outside source, also ensure that it defines the concept similarly to the above readings (As we've been learning with discourse communities, sometimes a word or phrase can be used differently in different fields).</p>

    <h2>Step 2: Create a handout for your classmates.</h2>
    <p>Once you've read several of the above sites on your topic above, organize your ideas for yourself. Then create a handout for your fellow classmates to teach them about this concept and how to apply it to their writing.</p>
    <p>You may organize the handout as you choose, as long as it's effective. Consider readability and the best way to present the information. If you were receiving this handout, how would you like the information organized?</p>
    <p>Typically, large blocks of text (long paragraphs) are ineffective for handouts.</p>
    <p>View the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tAshma9ytCW78lvV1B8c-e-akgXoXukz/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=100779942768131086967&rtpof=true&sd=true">Example Handout</a> for more information on how to effectively design a handout.</p>

    <h2>Step 3: Submit and distribute the handout</h2>
    <p>Submit a copy of the handout in the Canvas assignment before class</p>
    <p><strong>AND</strong></p>
    <p>Make eleven copies of the handout to distribute to your classmates in class.</p>
    <p><strong>OR</strong></p>
    <p>put a copy of the handout in the shared ENGL 1170 folder for your class. You can access this shared folder from the main page in our Canvas class.</p>

    <h2>Step 4: Present</h2>
    <p>Explain the concept to your classmates. This will be an informal presentation. You can stay in your seat and just talk to your classmates, but still come prepared to explain the most important concepts that you learned.</p>
    <p><strong>Do NOT read your handout.</strong> Have a plan for presenting/explaining this information. You might want to make a bulleted list on a separate piece of paper to reference during this presentation.</p>

    <h2>Grading</h2>
    <p>This will be graded on the following check system:</p>
    
    <div class="grid-container-2columns">
      <div class="grid-item">✓+</div>
      <div class="grid-item">All above criteria are met.</div>

      <div class="grid-item">✓</div>
      <div class="grid-item">One criterion is missing or hasn't been effectively completed, such as the student read their handout instead of presenting the ideas, or the handout is</div>

      <div class="grid-item">✓-</div>
      <div class="grid-item">Two or more criteria are missing or ineffective.</div>

      <div class="grid-item">NC</div>
      <div class="grid-item">Project has not been completed or is missing three or more criteria.</div>
    </div>
