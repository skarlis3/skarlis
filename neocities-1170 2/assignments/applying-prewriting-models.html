    <h1>Applying Prewriting Models</h1>

    <p>If you think that a blank sheet of paper or a blinking cursor on the computer screen is a scary sight, you are not alone. Many writers, students, and employees find that beginning to write can be intimidating. When faced with a blank page, however, experienced writers remind themselves that writing, like other everyday activities, is a process. Every process, from writing to cooking, bike riding, and learning to use a new cell phone, will get significantly easier with practice.</p>

    <p>Just as you need a recipe, ingredients, and proper tools to cook a delicious meal, you also need a plan, resources, and adequate time to create a good written composition. In other words, writing is a process that requires following steps and using strategies to accomplish your goals.</p>

    <h2>Writing in Process</h2>

    <p>These are the six steps in the writing process:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Prewriting</li>
      <li>Outlining the structure of ideas</li>
      <li>Writing a rough draft</li>
      <li>Revising</li>
      <li>Editing</li>
      <li>Submission</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Effective writing can be simply described as good ideas that are expressed well and arranged in the proper order. This chapter will give you the chance to work on all these important aspects of writing. Although many more prewriting strategies exist, this chapter covers six: using experience and observations, freewriting, asking questions, brainstorming, mapping, and searching the Internet. Using the strategies in this chapter can help you overcome the fear of the blank page and confidently begin the writing process.</p>

    <h2>Prewriting Techniques</h2>

    <h3>Freewriting</h3>

    <p>Freewriting is an exercise in which you write freely about any topic for a set amount of time (usually three to five minutes). During the time limit, you may jot down any thoughts that come to your mind. Try not to worry about grammar, spelling, or punctuation. Instead, write as quickly as you can without stopping. If you get stuck, just copy the same word or phrase over and over until you come up with a new thought.</p>

    <p>Writing often comes easier when you have a personal connection with the topic you have chosen. Remember, to generate ideas in your freewriting, you may also think about readings that you have enjoyed or that have challenged your thinking. Doing this may lead your thoughts in interesting directions.</p>

    <p>Quickly recording your thoughts on paper will help you discover what you have to say about a topic. When writing quickly, try not to doubt or question your ideas. Allow yourself to write freely and unselfconsciously. Once you start writing with few limitations, you may find you have more to say than you first realized. Your flow of thoughts can lead you to discover even more ideas about the topic. Freewriting may even lead you to discover another topic that excites you even more.</p>

    <p><strong>TIP:</strong> Some prewriting strategies can be used together. For example, you could use experience and observations to come up with a topic related to your course studies. Then you could use freewriting to describe your topic in more detail and figure out what you have to say about it.</p>

    <p><strong>Figure 5.1: Freewriting example</strong></p>

    <p>Last semester my favourite class was about mass media. We got to study radio and television. People say we watch too much television, and even though I tried not to, I end up watching a few reality shows just to relax. Everyone has to relax! It's too hard to relax when something like the news (my husband watches all the time) is on because it's too scary now. Too much bad news, not enough good news. News. Newspapers I don't read as much anymore. I can get the headlines on my homepage when I check my e-mail. E-mail could be considered mass media too these days. I used to go to the video store a few times a week before I started school, but now the only way I know what movies are current is to listen for the Oscar nominations. We have cable but we can't afford the movie channels, so I sometimes look at older movies late at night. UGH. A few of them get played again and again until you're sick of them. My husband thinks I'm crazy, but sometimes there are old black-and-whites from the 1930s and '40s. I could never live my life in black-and-white. I like the home decorating shows and love how people use colours on their walls. Makes rooms look so bright. When we buy a home, if we ever can, I'll use lots of colour. Some of those shows even show you how to do major renovations by yourself. Knock down walls and everything. Not for me – or my husband. I'm handier than he is. I wonder if they could make a reality show about us.</p>

    <h3>Asking Questions</h3>

    <p>Who? What? Where? When? Why? How? In everyday situations, you pose these kinds of questions to get more information. Who will be my partner for the project? When is the next meeting? Why is my car making that odd noise? Even the title of this chapter begins with the question "How do I begin?"</p>

    <p>You seek the answers to these questions to gain knowledge, to better understand your daily experiences, and to plan for the future. Asking these types of questions will also help you with the writing process. As you choose your topic, answering these questions can help you revisit the ideas you already have and generate new ways to think about your topic. You may also discover aspects of the topic that are unfamiliar to you and that you would like to learn more about. All these idea-gathering techniques will help you plan for future work on your assignment.</p>

    <p><strong>Who?</strong><br>
    I use media. Students, teachers, parents, employers and employees-almost everyone uses media.</p>

    <p><strong>What?</strong><br>
    The media can be a lot of things. Television, radio, e-mail (I think), newspapers, magazines, books.</p>

    <p><strong>Where?</strong><br>
    The media is almost everywhere now. It's in homes, at work, in cars, even on cell phones!</p>

    <p><strong>When?</strong><br>
    Media has been around for a long time, but seems a lot more important now.</p>

    <p><strong>When?</strong><br>
    Hmm. This is a good question. I don't know why there is mass media. Maybe we have it because we have the technology now. Or people live far away from their families and they have to stay in touch.</p>

    <p><strong>How?</strong><br>
    Well, media is possible because of the technology inventions, but I don't know how they all work!</p>

    <p><strong>TIP:</strong> You may find that you need to adjust your topic as you move through the writing stages (and as you complete the exercises in this chapter). If the topic you have chosen is not working, you can repeat the prewriting activities until you find a better one.</p>

    <p>Prewriting is very purpose driven; it does not follow a set of hard-and-fast rules. The purpose of prewriting is to find and explore ideas so that you will be prepared to write. A prewriting technique like asking questions can help you both find a topic and explore it. The key to effective prewriting is to use the techniques that work best for your thinking process. Freewriting may not seem to fit your thinking process, but keep an open mind. It may work better than you think. Perhaps brainstorming a list of topics might better fit your personal style.</p>

    <h2>More Prewriting Techniques</h2>

    <p>The prewriting techniques of freewriting and asking questions help students to think more about their topic, but the following prewriting strategies can help you narrow the focus of the topic:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Brainstorming</li>
      <li>Idea mapping</li>
      <li>Searching the Internet</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Narrowing the Focus</h3>

    <p>Narrowing the focus means breaking up the topic into subtopics, or more specific points. Generating lots of subtopics will help you eventually select the ones that fit the assignment and appeal to you and your audience.</p>

    <h3>Brainstorming (or Listing)</h3>

    <p>Brainstorming is similar to list making. You can make a list on your own or in a group with your classmates. Start with a blank sheet of paper (or a blank computer document) and write your general topic across the top. Underneath your topic, make a list of more specific ideas. Think of your general topic as a broad category and the list items as things that fit in that category. Often you will find that one item can lead to the next, creating a flow of ideas that can help you narrow your focus to a more specific paper topic.</p>

    <p>The following is a student's brainstorming list:</p>

    <p><strong>Figure 5.2</strong></p>

    <p>Imagine you have to write an e-mail to your current boss explaining your prior work experience, but you do not know where to start. Before you begin the e-mail, you can use the brainstorming technique to generate a list of employers, duties, and responsibilities that fall under the general topic "work experience."</p>

    <h3>Idea Mapping (or Clustering/Mind-mapping)</h3>

    <p>Idea mapping allows you to visualize your ideas on paper using circles, lines, and arrows. This technique is also known as clustering because ideas are broken down and clustered, or grouped together. Many writers like this method because the shapes show how the ideas relate or connect, and writers can find a focused topic from the connections mapped. Using idea mapping, you might discover interesting connections between topics that you had not thought of before.</p>

    <p>To create an idea map, start with your general topic in a circle in the center of a blank sheet of paper. Then write specific ideas around it and use lines or arrows to connect them together. Add and cluster as many ideas as you can think of.</p>

    <p><strong>Figure 5.3</strong></p>

    <p>Notice the largest circle contains a general topic, mass media. Then, the general topic branches into two subtopics written in two smaller circles: television and radio. The subtopic television branches into even more specific topics: cable and DVDs. From there, draw more circles and write more specific ideas: high definition and digital recording from cable and Blu-ray from DVDs. The radio topic leads to draw connections between music, downloads versus CDs, and, finally, piracy.</p>

    <p>From this idea map, you can narrow the focus of the mass media topic to the more specific topic of music piracy.</p>

    <h3>Searching the Internet</h3>

    <p>Using search engines on the Internet is a good way to see what kinds of websites are available on your topic. Writers use search engines not only to understand more about the topic's specific issues but also to get better acquainted with their audience.</p>

    <p><strong>TIP:</strong> Look back at the chart you completed in the second exercise. Did you guess at any of the answers? Searching the Internet may help you find answers to your questions and confirm your guesses. Be choosy about the websites you use. Make sure they are reliable sources for the kind of information you seek.</p>

    <p>When you search the Internet, type some key words from your broad topic or words from your narrowed focus into your browser's search engine (many good general and specialized search engines are available for you to try). Then look over the results for relevant and interesting articles.</p>

    <p>Results from an Internet search show writers the following information:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Who is talking about the topic</li>
      <li>How the topic is being discussed</li>
      <li>What specific points are currently being discussed about the topic</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>TIP:</strong> If the search engine results are not what you are looking for, revise your key words and search again. Some search engines also offer suggestions for related searches that may give you better results.</p>

    <p>Type the words music piracy from the idea map into the search engine Google.</p>

    <p><strong>Figure 5.4</strong></p>

    <p>Not all the results online search engines return will be useful or reliable. Give careful consideration to the reliability of an online source before selecting a topic based on it. Remember that factual information can be verified in other sources, both online and in print. If you have doubts about any information you find, either do not use it or identify it as potentially unreliable.</p>

    <h2>Checklist 5.1 Developing a Good Topic</h2>

    <p>The following checklist can help you decide if your narrowed topic is a good topic for your assignment.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Am I interested in this topic?</li>
      <li>Would my audience be interested?</li>
      <li>Do I have prior knowledge or experience with this topic? If so, would I be comfortable exploring this topic and sharing my experiences?</li>
      <li>Do I want to learn more about this topic?</li>
      <li>Is this topic specific?</li>
      <li>Does it fit the length of the assignment?</li>
    </ul>

    <p>With your narrowed focus in mind, answer the bulleted questions in the checklist 5.1 for developing a good topic. If you can answer "yes" to all the questions, write your topic on the line. If you answer "no" to any of the questions, think about another topic or adjust the one you have and try the prewriting strategies again.</p>
