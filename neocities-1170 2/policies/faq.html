    <h1>FAQs</h1>

    <h3>Does this class have a book?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>There is no textbook for this class, only online resources through this class website.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Where or when does this class meet?</h3>
    <p>The class meeting information can be found on your schedule in <a href="https://selfservice.macomb.edu/student">Self-Service</a> and on the syllabus. To view the syllabus in Canvas, click on the "Syllabus" link on the left navigation bar.</p>

    <h3>Where do I find our class materials and assignments?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>All readings can be found in the online <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/1181a/">textbook</a>.</li>
      <li>All other materials, resources, and assignments for this class will be found on our <a href="https://1181.karlismcc.com/">class website</a>.</li>
      <li>The assignments are also available on Canvas on the Assignments page.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How do I know what I need to do each week?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Everything that you will need to complete and the due dates (readings and assignments) will be listed on the schedule in the syllabus and on the class calendar on the <a href="https://1170.karlismcc.com/">class website</a>.</li>
      <li>You can also find the due dates for the assignments on Canvas. However, there will be additional due dates that will not show up in Canvas, such as readings and in-class due dates.</li>
      <li>We will also go over upcoming work at the start of every class period.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What can I do to help myself succeed in this class?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Show up to class.</strong> Missing one or two classes out of the entire semester might not be catastrophic, but if you find yourself skipping frequently, you will likely do poorly or possibly even fail the class.</li>
      <li><strong>Show up on time.</strong> The majority of the content for this class and the explanation of the assignments will be done within the first 30-40 minutes of class. The latter part of class will often be used for workshopping and active learning activities. If you regularly come to class late, you will likely find yourself lost and missing important information.</li>
      <li><strong>Complete all the readings.</strong> I do not assign a lot of mandatory reading, so the reading that is assigned will have important concepts that without which, you will likely fall behind.</li>
      <li><strong>Give yourself enough time to draft your papers and finish your assignments.</strong> Some of the assignments may be able to be completed quickly, such as the weekly essays during the early part of the ethnography. However, many will take a significant amount of time. It's essential that you give yourself enough time to complete the work in this class.</li>
      <li><strong>Make appointments with the Academic Success Center to get additional help.</strong> You can make an appointment through the Penji link on Canvas (look for the light blue penguin icon on the left).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What do I do if I can't get into Canvas or am having technical issues with Canvas?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Call Canvas support at <strong>877-362-2662</strong></li>
      <li>I don't have access to your account, so if something isn't working right or you are having technical difficulties with the site, you'll need to contact Macomb's Canvas support number above.</li>
    </ul>

    <p style="margin-top: 2rem;">If you have any further questions, don’t hesitate to email me, talk to me before or after class, or drop by during office hours.</p>
