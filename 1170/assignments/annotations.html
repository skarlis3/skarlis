    <h1>Annotations &amp; Poster</h1>

    <p>Your unrevised paper and your final polished draft will be displayed together on a poster board (feel free to reuse your tri-fold poster board from ENGL 1181). Additionally, you will use annotations to explain your unrevision choices to the audience.</p>

        <h2>Poster &amp; Annotation Guidelines</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>The poster can be a tri-fold board or a regular poster that can be taped to the wall. If you need more than one poster, that's also fine.</li>
      <li>The annotations should explain one of the unrevisions and connect to an example in the paper to demonstrate. You can use arrows, lines, color, highlighting or any other type of marking that works for the annotation.</li>
      <li>The annotations should also briefly explain the impact that specific unrevision is having on the paper.</li>
      <li>The poster presentation should demonstrate the visual rhetoric concepts from this class by being polished, readable, and well-designed. Additionally, the information should be presented in a way that is clear and well-organized (i.e. it should not look as if it was thrown together the night before with little thought to the design or layout).</li>
    </ol>

    <p>And finally, have fun with this! While you need to demonstrate an understanding of the course content through this project, you can have some fun with this project too. Be ridiculous and make your unrevision terrible.</p>

    <h3>Example Annotation</h3>
    <figure>
      <img src="/img/example-annotation.png" alt="Annotation Example: Text box pointing to a paragraph that reads: 'Paragraphing: To cause issues with the organization of the paper, I added more than one topic to each paragraph by mixing up my current paragraphs. This also means that the topic sentence isn't necessarily related to the main point of each paragraph, which makes the paragraph confusing and hard to follow.'" />
