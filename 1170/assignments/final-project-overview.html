    <h1>Final Project Overview</h1>

    <p>The Final Project will be a poster presentation that asks you to demonstrate an understanding of course content from both 1170 and 1181 in the form of an "Unrevision". You use your Project 1 essay for this project. After you have completed your 1181 revision, you will "unrevise" this paper for your 1170 project. The goal is to make the paper as ineffective as possible by using your understanding of the course concepts. The unrevised paper will be presented on a poster board along with the fully revised 1181 draft.</p>

    <h2>Process Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Complete the revision for ENGL 1181 first, so that you have the final version of the paper to start with.</li>
      <li>Use the concepts from the class to unrevise the paper. (See <a href="/assignments/unrevision.html">Unrevision Guidelines</a>).</li>
      <li>Display the unrevised paper alongside the final revised version (from ENGL 1181) of the paper on a poster board or tri-fold board.</li>
      <li>Annotate your unrevised paper to show where you used the various class concepts to unrevise the draft. (See <a href="/assignments/annotations.html">Annotations &amp; Poster</a>).</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Rubric and Grading</h2>
    <p>Your Final Project must include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your final revision of your Project 1 essay from ENGL 1181</li>
      <li>An unrevised draft of that same paper.</li>
      <li>Annotations to explain the unrevision and how that impacts the paper.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Your Final Project will be graded on the following rubric:</p>

    <div class="grid-container-2columns">
      <div class="grid-item"><strong>5/5</strong></div>
      <div class="grid-item">The Final Project meets all requirements for this project. The unrevision includes a thoughtful and clearly intentional use of class concepts to make the paper ineffective. The annotations explain the concept used to unrevise the paper and the impact that choice of unrevision has on the readability or effectiveness of the paper.</div>

      <div class="grid-item"><strong>4/5</strong></div>
      <div class="grid-item">The final project meets all requirements for this project. It also mostly meets the requirements for a 5/5 paper, but it might not effectively explain the impact of the unrevision or it's not always clear how the unrevision connects to class concepts based on the annotations. Or the poster presentation does not display an understanding of visual rhetoric through its layout or design.</div>

      <div class="grid-item"><strong>3/5</strong></div>
      <div class="grid-item">The final project mostly meets the requirements but the guidelines are not effectively met. For example, the annotations are present but might not connect the unrevision to class concepts or medium to large sections of the paper appear to not be unrevised.</div>

      <div class="grid-item"><strong>2/5</strong></div>
      <div class="grid-item">The final project is missing at least one of the requirements in the guidelines. For example, annotations are missing or do not demonstrate class concepts. Or the poster presentation does not display an understanding of visual rhetoric through its layout or design appears to have been put together hastily with little thought to the presentation.</div>

      <div class="grid-item"><strong>1/5</strong></div>
      <div class="grid-item">The final project has significant issues and is missing two or more of the requirements listed in the guidelines.</div>

      <div class="grid-item"><strong>0/5</strong></div>
      <div class="grid-item">The final project was not turned in.</div>
    </div>

    <p>I will grade the presentations during class, and you will take your poster presentation home with you at the end of the class period. Since this is the last day of class, you must be in class that day to present. Late Final Projects will not be accepted except in cases of documentable emergencies.</p>
