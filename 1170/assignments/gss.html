    <h1>Grammar, Style, and Structure</h1>

    <p>Starting in Week 3, each week will include grammar, style, and structure lesson(s) for you to read and watch. These lessons are designed to help fill in any gaps you might have with your writing mechanics, ensuring you have a strong foundation for your essays and projects.</p>

    <h2>Assignment Details</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Lessons:</strong> Watch the video/read the lesson, then complete a short 5-question quiz.</li>
      <li><strong>Location:</strong> All videos, readings, and quizzes can be found <strong>on the module page</strong> on the ENGL 1170 Canvas site.</li>
      <li><strong>Attempts:</strong> You get <strong>two attempts</strong> per quiz. (The first week you get three to account for learning how to use Canvas quizzes.)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Schedule &amp; Deadlines</h2>
    <p>Consistency and keeping up with these is key for these assignments. The lessons and quizzes are not meant to be overly difficult, but you will need to remember to do them each week. Please keep the following timing in mind:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Due Date:</strong> Quizzes are due on <strong>Fridays</strong>.</li>
      <li><strong>Grace Period:</strong> There is a grace period until <strong>Sunday night</strong>.</li>
      <li><strong>Hard Deadline:</strong> Because the answers are automatically released on Monday morning, these <strong>cannot be completed</strong> after the grace period has ended.</li>
    </ul>

      <h3>Working Ahead</h3>
      <p>You are encouraged to work ahead! All lessons and quizzes are available in advance, so feel free to complete them early to give yourself additional buffer time during busy weeks.</p>
