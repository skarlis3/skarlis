    <h1>Writing Studio</h1>

    <p>Classes dedicated as Writing Studio days are meant to help you set goals, work on your writing, and reflect on your progress. These classes have the flexibility to allow you to choose what to work on with your writing, and can be used to focus on any stage in the writing process. Additionally, these are days where you can get help from me or our embedded writing tutor (when available).</p>

    <h2>Receiving Credit</h2>
    <p>You will receive credit on Writing Studio Days for...</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Being present</li>
      <li>Stating a goal/plan for studio time</li>
      <li>Turning in your Writing Studio Check-in at the end of class.
        <ul>
          <li>This will be submitted on paper.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Writing Studio Check-In Assignment</h2>
    <p>At the end of class on Writing Studio days, turn in a piece of paper with the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your name</li>
      <li>Your stated goal at the beginning of class</li>
      <li>A short reflection on the progress made towards your goal
        <ul>
          <li>This should be informal and can be written out as a few sentences or as a bulleted list.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Your writing goals/plan for over the next week.
        <ul>
          <li>Think about what ENGL 1181 work you need to do and/or skills you want to work on. It can be for any part of the writing process, such as brainstorming, planning, organizing your ideas, etc.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What happens if I'm absent on a Writing Studio day?</h3>
    <p>You can replace up to two missed Writing Studio sessions by working with a writing tutor at the Academic Success Center (ASC). The session can focus on writing or reading for any class (not subjects like math), but it can’t count for both ENGL 1170 and ENGL 1181—you’ll need to pick one.</p>
    
    <p>After your session, let me know in class and forward the confirmation email from the ASC. At the top of the email, please add a note like:</p>

    <div class="indented-text">
      <p>This is for ENGL 1170 to replace the Writing Lab I missed on May 23rd.</p>
