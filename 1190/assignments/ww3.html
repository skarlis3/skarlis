    <h1>Weekly Writing 3</h1>
    <h2>Discussions About AI in Your Career/Field</h2>

    <h3>Requirements</h3>
    <p><b>Length:</b> No minimum<br/>
       <b>Genre:</b> Question &amp; Answer<br/>
       <b>Assignment AI Policy:</b> Do not use GenAI for this assignment.<br/>
       <b>Additional requirement:</b> PDFs or recordings of online posts/discussions
    </p>
    <p>For more information about these assignments, see the Weekly Writing Overview page.</p>

    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>For Weekly Writing 3, we will start moving into one of the major topics for this semester: artificial intelligence and how it's impacting that career/major. For this week, you will look online to find conversations from people in your potential field.</p>
    <p>You don't have to find something specific to one job in the field—looking at the field in general is fine. For example, if you are planning to go into teaching preschool, you could look at AI in education at the early childhood or elementary level.</p>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>First, find at least one online spaces where people are talking about the job/career/field. This could be on Reddit, a Facebook group, TikTok or someplace else.</li>
      <li>Then use the search function to find conversations about AI in the field. For forums/online groups, create PDFs of at least two different conversations about AI or GenAI in that field/job. For videos, download or screenrecord the video. (See additional instructions below).</li>
      <li>Then respond to the following questions:<br/>
        <em>Note: This does not have to be written as a short essay this week! You can just list the questions and then answer them.</em>
        <ul>
          <li>Where did you read/watch the conversations or posts? (i.e. a particular subreddit? on TikTok? a Facebook group? etc.)</li>
          <li>What do the poster and/or commenters say about how AI is being used in this career/field?</li>
          <li>Based on these posts/comments, how do people seem to feel about AI in this career/field?</li>
          <li>What are your thoughts on AI in this field based on what you know or what you read/watched in these posts?</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Finally, upload the posts/videos and submit your Weekly Writing document to Canvas.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Additional Instructions</h2>

    <h3>Text-based Posts/Discussions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>For text-based conversations or posts, such as Reddit, Facebook, or other online forums, create a PDF of the posts in question.
        <ul>
          <li>For private groups, please blur out any names/identifying information. For public posts, you can leave it.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>To create a PDF, follow these instructions:
        <ul>
          <li>Creating a PDF on Windows</li>
          <li>Creating a PDF on Mac</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Video-based Posts/Discussion</h3>
    <p>For video posts about AI in a career/field, either download or screenrecord the video. TikTok allows directly downloading from the post, but for other social media, you may need to use the screen recording on your phone/device.</p>

    <h3>Submitting the Conversations</h3>
    <p>Once you have saved the posts/discussions, you will need to upload it to the assignment in Canvas along with the document with your Weekly Writing on it.</p>
