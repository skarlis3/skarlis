    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>Build on what you wrote for Weekly Writing 1 to clarify which major or career you want to focus on this semester and what you know or wonder about it.</p>
    <p>If you need more information on a job/career path while writing, the
      <a href="https://www.bls.gov/ooh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Occupational Outlook Handbook</a> is a helpful starting point.
    </p>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>State your focus:</strong> At the top of your document, name the major and/or career you plan to focus on this semester.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Respond in a short and informal essay (in paragraph form; don’t list the prompts):</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>What do you already know about this career/major? What interests you about it?</li>
          <li>What concerns do you have about it as a potential path?</li>
          <li>What do you know (if anything) about how technology is or isn’t used in this field (software/apps, equipment, etc.)?</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p><em>Note:</em> Use the prompts to guide a thoughtful response—do not copy/paste them and answer one by one.</p>
