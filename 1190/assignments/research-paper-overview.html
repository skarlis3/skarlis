    <!-- Overview -->
    <h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
    <p>
      For Project 1, you will write a research paper exploring
      <b>how AI is being used, discussed, and debated in the field or career you plan to enter</b>.
      This project is the foundation for the work you will do later in the course, and you will
      return to this research in different ways as the semester continues.
    </p>
    <p>
      The goal is to understand what is actually happening with AI in your field&mdash;not just hype
      or generic predictions&mdash;and to use credible research and real conversations to explain
      what issues matter right now in that field.
    </p>

    <!-- Purpose -->
    <h3 id="purpose">Purpose</h3>
    <p>This project is designed to help you:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Investigate a real question that affects your possible future field or career.</li>
      <li>Learn how to find and evaluate different types of sources (social media, news, scholarly).</li>
      <li>Join a current conversation that professionals, workers, and experts are already having.</li>
      <li>Practice research writing, including research, evaluation, synthesis, and analysis.</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- Your Task -->
    <h3 id="task">Your Task</h3>
    <p>Your paper should:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Identify how AI is currently being used in your chosen field or career
        (for example, specific tools or tasks).
      </li>
      <li>
        Explain what people in the field are talking about&mdash;benefits, risks, ethical concerns,
        workplace changes, trends, and disagreements.
      </li>
      <li>
        Put different types of sources in conversation by showing how public discussions,
        news reporting, and scholarly research confirm, complicate, or challenge one another.
      </li>
      <li>
        Make a clear, focused argument or main point about what these conversations suggest
        for the field’s present and future.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      You do not need to come to one definitive conclusion about AI in your field. Instead, your job is to put different viewpoints in conversation and help readers understand the range of possibilities, concerns, and tensions shaping your field’s relationship with AI.</p>

    <!-- Length & Formatting -->
    <h3 id="length-formatting">Length &amp; Formatting</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Length:</b> 2000 words minimum (which is roughly 7&ndash;10 pages) of writing</li>
      <li><b>Title page:</b> APA format</li>
      <li><b>In-text citations:</b> APA style for all quoted, paraphrased, or summarized material</li>
      <li><b>References page:</b> Separate APA References page</li>
      <li><b>Document format:</b> Typed, double-spaced, standard font and margins</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- Required Sources -->
    <h3 id="required-sources">Required Sources</h3>
    <p>
      You must use <b>all three of the following source types</b> in your paper. You can exceed these
      numbers, but you should not have fewer than the minimum listed.
    </p>

    <h4>Public Conversations (at least 2)</h4>
    <p>
      These are places where people in your field talk to each other about real issues, experiences,
      and concerns related to AI. Examples include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Reddit threads or professional subreddits,</li>
      <li>Substack comment sections,</li>
      <li>professional Facebook groups,</li>
      <li>LinkedIn posts or comment threads,</li>
      <li>Discord channels or Slack communities,</li>
      <li>TikTok or Instagram comment sections focused on your field.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>News Articles (at least 2)</h4>
    <p>
      These should be credible journalistic sources that report on AI’s role in your field.
      They might describe new tools, workplace changes, policies, controversies, or trends.
    </p>

    <h4>Peer-Reviewed Scholarly Articles (at least 4)</h4>
    <p>
      These are research-based sources from academic journals or peer-reviewed publications.
      They might analyze how AI is being implemented, study its effects, or discuss professional
      and ethical implications in your field.
    </p>

<div class="tips-accent-box">
    <h3>Note</h3>
    <p>
      These numbers are the <strong>minimum</strong>. You may find you need additional sources
      to explain the complexities of your field or to support your argument more fully.
      You are encouraged to use more sources whenever they help you develop, clarify,
      or strengthen your analysis.
    </p>
    <p>Additionally, the more research you have, the more you will have to write about. In other words, additional research typically will make it easier to write this paper and be less work for you in the long run.</p>
    
    </div>

    <!-- Suggested Structure -->
    <h3 id="structure">Suggested Structure</h3>
    <p>
      You have several options for how to organize this paper. Many students find it helpful to
      move from background, to current uses, to public conversations, to scholarly perspectives,
      but there is not just one correct way to structure the project.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your structure should support your main point and help readers follow your reasoning clearly.
      </p>
      <p> See <a href="/assignments/example-organization.html">Example Organization</a> for some examples of potential organization for this paper.</p>
    

    <!-- Connection to Weekly Writing -->
    <h3 id="weekly-writing">Connection to Weekly Writing</h3>
    <p>
      Your Weekly Writing assignments are designed to build the research and thinking you need
      for this project. By the time you begin drafting the full paper, you will already have:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>chosen a field or career to focus on,</li>
      <li>identified what you already know and what you want to learn,</li>
      <li>explored public conversations about AI in that field,</li>
      <li>collected news coverage about AI-related changes or debates, and</li>
      <li>located and read scholarly research connected to your topic.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Think of Project 1 as pulling together all of that work into one sustained, organized,
      and thoughtful research paper.
