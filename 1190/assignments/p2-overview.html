    <h1>Project 2: Museum Exhibit from the Year 2050</hi>
    <h2>Overview</h2>

    <p>For Project 2, you are going to take the research and conclusions you drew from Project 1 to create a <strong>multimodal "museum exhibit" display</strong>. You will include artifacts from your Project 1 and new artifacts from the near future, up until 2050 (you get to make stuff up here), to show how AI evolved in your field.</p>


    <div class="tips-accent-box">
      <h3>The Premise</h3>
      <p>The year is 2050. You are curating an exhibit on how AI changed your field.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Take research/conclusions from Project 1.</li>
        <li>Create a museum exhibit for the year 2050.</li>
        <li>Include artifacts from Project 1 (the past) and new "made up" artifacts from the near future (2027–2050).</li>
      </ul>
    </div>


    <h2>Step 1: Decision Time</h2>
    <p>First, you need to decide what direction AI in your field went. You can choose from the following options:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>The Golden Age (A Utopian Future):</strong> The most optimistic research was correct. AI fixed problems and helped the field flourish. Everything is better than ever.</li>
      <li><strong>System Failure (A Dystopian Future):</strong> The warnings were ignored and some of the worst predictions came true. The field became a mess.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For either of these paths, you get to decide what happened. Just make sure your ideas are rooted in the conversations and research that is happening now.</p>


    <h2>Project Roadmap</h2>
    <p>Once you have decided on your timeline (Step 1 above), follow these steps to complete the project:</p>

    <div class="callout">
      <h3>Steps 2 &amp; 3: Creating the Artifacts</h3>
      <p>Gather your real research from Project 1 and create fictional "future" artifacts (from 2025–2050) to tell the story of how your field changed.</p>

    <div class="callout">
      <h3>Step 4: Building the Exhibit</h3>
      <p>Curate your physical display, write your museum placards, and create the Museum Guide handout.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="callout">
      <h3>Exhibit Day &amp; Visitor Report</h3>
      <p>Review the setup logistics for the pop-up museum day and the requirements for the Visitor Report assignment.</p>
