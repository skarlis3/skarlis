    <h1>Project 2: Creating the Artifacts</h1>


    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Your exhibit will consist of a mix of "real" history (what is happening today) and "future" history (what you imagine happens between now and 2050).</p>


    <h2>Step 2: Gathering Real Artifacts (Present Day)</h2>
    <p>You will gather artifacts from present day. These should come from your research on public conversations, news articles, and scholarly research. Include important snippets from these documents/items to demonstrate where it all started.</p>

    <div class="tips-accent-box">
      <h3>Requirements: Real Artifacts</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Minimum of 3 existing artifacts.</strong></li>
        <li>Can be snippets of news articles, scholarly articles, or screenshots of online posts/conversations.</li>
        <li>These must come from your Project 1 research.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>


    <h2>Step 3: Creating New Artifacts (Future)</h2>
    <p>This part involves creative writing. You will create additional artifacts from the future (i.e., events that happen between now and 2050) to show the events that led to the eventual Dystopian or Utopian future.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Guidelines for Future Artifacts:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Logical Progression:</strong> They should be loosely based on your research—a logical continuation of the topics from Project 1, not entirely new topics.</li>
      <li><strong>Variety:</strong> Create fictional social media posts, news, or even summaries of research articles that are written in the future.</li>
      <li><strong>Visuals:</strong> <strong>At least one of these artifacts should be visual in nature</strong>, such as a chart, graphic, map, etc., to show how this change impacted the field.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In your exhibit, these artifacts will still be treated as "history" since our museum exhibits are taking place in 2050.</p>

      <h3>Requirements: Future Artifacts</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Minimum of 5 future artifacts</strong> to show the changes over time from today to 2050.</li>
        <li><em>Example:</em> You may want to include a social media post from 2030, a couple of artifacts from the late 2030s, and a few artifacts from the 2040s.</li>
      </ul>
