    <h1>Project 2: Exhibit Day &amp; Visitor Report</h1>


    <h2>Arrival &amp; Setup</h2>
    <p>On Exhibit Day, please do the following when you arrive in class::</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Setup:</strong> Find a spot and set up your exhibit.</li>
      <li><strong>Safety:</strong> Make sure all bags/stuff are put away and not going to be a trip hazard for students walking around.</li>
      <li><strong>Identification:</strong> Make sure your name is clearly visible on the project. If not, get a post-it note from me to add it. This ensures I know whose project it is when I take photos for grading records.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Museum Visitor Report</h2>
    <p>Once everyone is set up, you will walk around and complete a <strong>Museum Visitor Report</strong>. You will need to record the following information:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Best Warning:</strong> Which "System Failure" exhibit had the most concerning or scariest data point?</li>
      <li><strong>Best Hope:</strong> Which "Golden Age" exhibit had the most exciting innovation?</li>
      <li><strong>Something Interesting (real artifact):</strong> Write down one specific piece of information you learned from someone’s display from one of their real (current) artifacts. Also include the name of the museum exhibit.</li>
      <li><strong>Most Creative (future artifact):</strong> Write down which future artifact was the most creative (this could be based on humor, out-of-the-box thinking, or something else). Also include the name of the museum exhibit.</li>
    </ul>
