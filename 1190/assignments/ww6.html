    <h1>Weekly Writing 6</h1>
    <h2>Annotated Scholarly Research</h2>

    <!-- Requirements -->
    <h3>Requirements</h3>
    <p><b>Length:</b> 2 annotated scholarly articles + 2–4 additional potential sources<br/>
       <b>Genre:</b> Annotations + list of additional possible sources<br/>
       <b>Assignment AI Policy:</b> Do not use GenAI to summarize or annotate your articles. You may use AI to help you search for sources (see <em>Using AI for Research</em> for tips on how to use it appropriately).
    </p>

    <!-- Overview -->
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>This week, you will begin finding and reading scholarly research related to how AI is being used in (or impacting) the career/major you’ve chosen to focus on.</p>

    <p>Your goal is to thoughtfully read two scholarly, peer-reviewed articles closely and show your thinking through annotations. You will also identify 2–4 additional scholarly sources that might be useful as you continue researching.</p>

    <h3>Part 1: Annotated Scholarly Articles (2 required)</h3>
    <p>This part of the assignment will help you learn how to: read scholarly research, keep track of your thoughts while you are reading, and organize your research for research papers and projects.</p>

    <h4>Directions for Part 1</h4>

    <ol>
      <li><b>Find scholarly sources</b> on your topic (published recently—often within the last two years for AI-related topics).</li>

      <li><b>Download the PDFs</b> to your laptop/tablet or save them into Google Drive.</li>

      <li><b>Annotate the PDF article:</b>
        <ul>
          <li>Highlight main ideas and concepts.</li>
          <li>Add comments about things that stand out to you, confuse you, or connect to the social media/news conversations you’ve already researched.</li>
          <li>Ask questions or note what you want to explore further.</li>
          <li>Your annotations do not need to be formal; use your natural and casual writing voice and style for this assignment.</li>
          <li>I’m looking to see that you are reading, understanding, and engaging with the concepts in the article.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li><b>Write a short note/annotation at the top of each PDF (1–2 sentences)</b> that:
        <ul>
          <li>Explains how it relates to your research topic.</li>
          <li>Mentions how it connects to anything else you’ve read so far (news, social media, or other articles).</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li><b>Submit each PDF</b> with your annotations included to the Canvas assignment.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Part 2: Additional Possible Scholarly Sources (2–4 required)</h3>

    <p>The second part of this assignment helps you continue gathering research for your final paper. You’ll eventually need at least four scholarly sources, and this step ensures you’re building a wider pool of possible articles. These additional sources may or may not end up in your final draft—that’s normal as your research question becomes more focused and you learn more about your topic.</p>

    <h4>Directions for Part 2</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>On a Word document, <b>list an additional 2–4 scholarly, peer-reviewed articles</b> you may want to use in your final paper.</li>
      <li><b>For each source, include:</b>
        <ul>
          <li>The author(s), article title, and journal it was published in</li>
          <li>A working link (double-check all links!)</li>
          <li>1–2 sentences about why it might be useful or interesting and/or how it connects to your other research (scholarly, news, and/or social media)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>You do <b>not</b> need to annotate these.</li>
      <li><b>Submit this document to Canvas</b> along with your two annotated articles.</li>
    </ol>
