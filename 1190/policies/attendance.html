    <h1>Attendance</h1>

    <p>Since this is an in-person class, attendance is crucial for your success. We will cover materials in class that are not available online or in readings.</p>

    <p>I understand that life happens and do not want to penalize students who are keeping up with their work but encounter a major life event during the semester. However, there comes a point when missing too many classes can hinder your ability to complete the course effectively. The attendance policy is designed to balance these considerations.</p>

    <h2>Attendance Policy at a Glance</h2>

    <h3>For classes that meet once a week:</h3>
    <p>This policy applies to hybrid classes and any sections that only meet once a week:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>More than 5 absences will result in failing the class.</li>
      <li>Try to be on time. Most major class content will be covered in the first 30-40 minutes, allowing for team and individual work time and class discussions.</li>
      <li>Consistently arriving more than 30 minutes late will be counted as absences.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>For classes that meet twice a week:</h3>
    <p>This policy applies to in-person classes that meet twice a week:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>More than 7 absences will result in failing the class.</li>
      <li>Try to be on time. Most major class content will be covered in the first 30-40 minutes, allowing for team and individual work time and class discussions.</li>
      <li>Consistently arriving more than 30 minutes late will be counted as absences.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Other Notes on Attendance</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Stay home if you're sick. This attendance policy allows for roughly one month of absences for emergencies, illness, mental health days, etc. Please don't get your fellow students sick by coming to class while contagious.</li>
      <li>Show up when you can. If you skip three weeks of classes and then get sick, the attendance policy still applies.</li>
      <li>Contact your teammates if you are absent to find out what you missed.</li>
      <li>Keep in touch if you're facing a major life event or are concerned about your ability to attend class regularly. My ability to help you stay on track or adjust timelines depends on timely communication. If you contact me well after a major assignment was due, there's not much that can be done.</li>
    </ul>
